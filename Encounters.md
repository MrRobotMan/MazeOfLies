# The setting

You find yourself in a square room, connected by passageways to other rooms. There may be doors.

## Stephanie
Welcome to the maze! I’m Stephanie, and I’m in charge of your welcome orientation.

This maze consists of a bunch of rooms connected to each other by open passages, or sometimes by doors.  
The doors delimit regions of the maze. There are general rules that apply to the whole maze, and additional 
rules that apply to specific regions.  

As you explore, you will encounter other people who work here. They will tell you about some of the rules. 
The key thing you should know is that some of them are liars, and they lie all the time, so none of the 
statements they make are true; the others tell the truth all the time. All the true statements you will 
hear about rules that apply in specific regions of the maze refer to different regions. But you will need 
to figure out for yourself who is telling the truth and who is lying.

## Daniel
Everyone here lies all the time. In particular Stephanie lies all the time. You should listen only to me.
I’m pretty sure Stephanie didn’t even tell you the truth about what you’re supposed to do here.

You see, some of the rooms of this maze used to contain a single digit from 1 to 8, while others remained 
empty, in such a way that if two rooms that lie due East or due North of each other happen to contain the
same digit, then the distance between these rooms must be greater than the value of that digit; and rooms 
containing identical digits cannot touch each other by a corner.

Oh, and I have to warn you that Maurice is also a liar.

## Maurice
Every room of this maze used to contain a single digit from 1 to 9, in such a way that two rooms that lie due 
East or due North of each other can’t contain the same digits, and two rooms that can be joined without passing 
through a door can’t contain the same digits either.

Only one of the digits remains visible -- a five -- perhaps you’ve seen it already? And in fact, there are
two other 5’s that you will be able to place into the maze as soon as you have learned the rules for their 
respective regions. Anyway, it would be great if you could help us figure out all the missing digits!

## Patrick
It must be pretty confusing to not know who is being truthful with you... I hope you sort it out. In any case,
you should know that Maurice and Helen are both telling the truth.

There is a region of the maze whose only door opens to the West, in which any two adjacent rooms (not separated
by a wall or door) must contain digits which differ by at least 4. In another region, any two adjacent rooms
(again, not separated by a wall or door) must contain digits which differ by a power of 2. And in yet another 
region, any two adjacent rooms (still not separated by a wall or door) must contain digits which differ by at
least 2.

## Caroline
In one of the regions of the maze, the largest and smallest digits encountered along the shortest path between 
the only two doors are those right next to the doors. In another region, along the shortest path between the only
two doors, the digit right next to one door is equal to the sum of all the others. And in yet another region, 
the digits encountered along the shortest path between the only two doors are in increasing or decreasing order
along the path. You seem pretty smart, so it shouldn’t be hard for you to figure out which three regions I’m 
talking about.

By the way, Annabelle is a liar.

## Valdimir
You need to know that Patrick is a liar. Here’s the correct information he won’t tell you.

In a region of the maze whose only door opens to the South, the numbers formed by reading the digits North to 
South from wall to wall (or door), or from West to East from wall to wall, are all perfect squares. In another
region, the numbers formed in this way are all prime. And in yet another region, the numbers formed in this way
are all multiples of 7.

## Helen
Exactly one of Annabelle and Jessica is a liar.

Also, one of the regions of the maze contains the exact same digits in the same relative positions as another
identically shaped region.

## Annabelle
In one of the regions of the maze, the digits encountered along the shortest path between the only two doors 
alternate between odd and even. In another region, the digits encountered along the shortest path between the 
only two doors form a prime number when read in the correct direction. And in yet another region, the product 
of the digits encountered along the shortest path between the only two doors is a perfect square. Surely you’ll
be able to figure out which three regions I’m talking about.

And, by the way, Caroline is a liar.

## Jessica
There are either three or four liars among us.

About the maze: in a region whose only door opens to the North, any two adjacent rooms (not separated by a wall or 
door) may not both contain digits that are prime numbers. Even better: in a region whose only door opens to the 
East, any two adjacent rooms (not separated by a wall or door) must contain digits whose difference is 1 or 
whose ratio is 2.
